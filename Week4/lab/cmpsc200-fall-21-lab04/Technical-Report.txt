-----

1) Why do we have a if/else logic between line number 12 and 16 in fbi.c? Why can't we just do one printf? 
2) Why do we use unsigned long rather use an int in fbi.c? Do some experiments yourself
3) Why do we have a logic to add a number 64 in line number 29 in eye.c? What is the purpose? Answer after thinking through and doing some code logic testing.
